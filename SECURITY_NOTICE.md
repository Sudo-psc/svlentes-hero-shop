# ðŸš¨ SECURITY NOTICE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Incident:** Production secrets exposed in git repository  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

## What Happened

In commit `961f9f852acdb2703b01f0300fffca09eb42db6e`, the following production credentials were accidentally committed to the repository:

1. **NEXTAUTH_SECRET** - Authentication secret key
2. **ASAAS_API_KEY_PROD** - Production payment gateway API key  
3. **DATABASE_URL** - PostgreSQL database credentials with password
4. **Firebase API keys** - Complete Firebase configuration

## Immediate Actions Required

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Removed `.env.production` from repository
- [x] Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future exposure
- [x] Removed binary and temporary files

### ðŸ”´ MUST DO NOW (Before merging to production)

1. **Rotate NEXTAUTH_SECRET**
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
   Update in your hosting platform (Vercel, AWS, etc.)

2. **Regenerate Asaas API Keys**
   - Login to Asaas dashboard
   - Invalidate current production API key
   - Generate new production API key
   - Update in hosting platform environment variables

3. **Change Database Password**
   ```sql
   ALTER USER n8nuser WITH PASSWORD 'new_secure_password_here';
   ```
   Update `DATABASE_URL` in hosting platform

4. **Rotate Firebase Keys (if possible)**
   - Check Firebase Console for key rotation options
   - Update Firebase configuration in hosting platform
   - Note: Some Firebase keys cannot be easily rotated

5. **Update Environment Variables in Hosting Platform**
   
   **For Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel env add NEXTAUTH_SECRET production
   vercel env add ASAAS_API_KEY_PROD production
   vercel env add DATABASE_URL production
   ```
   
   **For AWS/Other platforms:**
   - Use your platform's secrets management system
   - Never commit secrets to git again

## Prevention Measures

### For Developers

1. **Never commit .env files** (except .env.example)
   - `.env`
   - `.env.local`
   - `.env.production`
   - `.env.development`

2. **Always check before committing:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff --staged
   ```

3. **Use pre-commit hooks:**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev husky
   npx husky install
   npx husky add .git/hooks/pre-commit "npm run lint"
   ```

4. **Scan for secrets:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g git-secrets
   git secrets --install
   git secrets --register-aws
   ```

### Security Checklist

Before every commit:
- [ ] No .env files in git status
- [ ] No hardcoded API keys in code
- [ ] No passwords in comments
- [ ] No database credentials in code
- [ ] .gitignore is up to date

## Files Updated

âœ… `.gitignore` - Added:
```
.env.production
.env.tmp
.local/
*.bin
*.tmp
```

âœ… Removed from repository:
- `.env.production` (contained secrets)
- `.env.tmp` (temporary file)
- `.local/state/` (18 binary files)

## What to Do If You Have Repository Access

If you cloned this repository before October 16, 2025:

1. **Delete your local copy**
2. **Clone fresh** after the security fixes are merged
3. **Never use the exposed credentials** - they should all be rotated
