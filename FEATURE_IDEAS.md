- Reduced customer engagement between deliveries
- Missed opportunities for upselling additional products

### Proposed Solution
Implement an intelligent reminder system that learns from user behavior and sends personalized notifications through multiple channels (email, WhatsApp, SMS, push notifications).

### Key Features

1. **Adaptive Reminder Schedule**
   - Track when users typically replace their lenses
   - Machine learning to predict optimal reminder timing based on:
     - Plan type (daily, monthly, multifocal)
     - Historical usage patterns
     - Previous reminder response rates
   - Adjust notification frequency to reduce alert fatigue

2. **Multi-Channel Notifications**
   - WhatsApp messages (via WhatsApp Business API integration)
   - Email reminders
   - SMS for critical reminders
   - Push notifications (when mobile app is available)
   - In-dashboard notifications

3. **Interactive Reminder Actions**
   - "Already changed" confirmation button
   - "Remind me later" (with smart rescheduling)
   - "Order extra lenses" quick action
   - "Schedule consultation" if issues reported

4. **Health-Focused Insights**
   - Track streak of timely replacements (gamification)
   - Share eye health tips based on lens type
   - Alert if user consistently delays replacements
   - Automatic notification to Dr. Philipe for users with poor compliance

5. **Integration Points**
   - Connect with existing subscription data
   - Leverage Asaas billing cycle information
   - Use existing WhatsApp redirect API
   - Integrate with area-assinante dashboard

     - Environment (AC, outdoors, computer work)
     - Previous lens experience
     - Eye sensitivity level
     - Budget constraints
     - Aesthetic preferences (for colored lenses)
   
   - AI-powered matching algorithm:
     - Match user profile to optimal lens type
     - Consider prescription requirements
     - Factor in lifestyle and usage patterns
     - Recommend plan tier based on needs

3. **Interactive Lens Education Center**
   - 3D visualizations of lens types
   - Compare daily vs. monthly vs. multifocal
   - Animated guides showing proper insertion/removal
   - Material and technology explanations
   - Before/after vision comparison tools

4. **Personalized Journey**
   - Create user profile before subscription
   - Save try-on history and preferences
   - Get notifications when new lens types match profile
   - Build trust through education before commitment

5. **Prescription Analysis Tool**
   - Upload prescription photo (OCR)
   - Validate prescription data
   - Automatic plan recommendations based on prescription
   - Flag if prescription needs renewal
   - Suggest consultation with Dr. Philipe if needed
