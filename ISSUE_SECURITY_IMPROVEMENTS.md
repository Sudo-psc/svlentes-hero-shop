# Add critical security features to admin and webhook systems

## Issue Overview
Several security-critical endpoints and webhook integrations lack proper authentication and validation, creating potential security vulnerabilities.

## High Priority Security Issues

### 1. Admin Authentication Gaps
**Files Affected:**
- `src/app/api/admin/history-recovery/route.ts:13,42,68`
- `src/app/api/admin/support/tickets/[id]/assign/route.ts:260,494`

**Problems:**
- Admin authentication checks commented out: `// TODO: Add admin authentication check`
- Sensitive admin operations without proper access control
- Risk of unauthorized access to system history and support data

### 2. Webhook Security Vulnerabilities
**Files Affected:**
- `src/lib/sendpulse-client.ts:728`
- `src/app/api/webhooks/sendpulse/route.ts:277,528,535,722,741,1252,1277`

**Problems:**
- `// TODO: Implement webhook signature validation if SendPulse provides it`
- Missing request validation for webhook endpoints
- Potential for malicious webhook payloads

### 3. Debug Information Exposure
**Files Affected:**
- Multiple webhook route files with disabled debug utilities

**Problems:**
- Debug utilities commented out but code may still expose sensitive information
- Risk of leaking user data or system internals in error responses

## Solution Requirements

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Implement Admin Authentication**
   - Add authentication middleware to all admin endpoints
   - Implement proper role-based access control
   - Create admin user management system

2. **Webhook Signature Validation**
   - Implement SendPulse webhook signature validation
   - Add request payload verification
   - Rate limiting for webhook endpoints

3. **Secure Debug Information**
   - Remove or properly secure debug utilities
   - Ensure no sensitive data leaks in production

### Medium Priority
4. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Implement secure audit logging
   - Add security event monitoring
   - Create security incident response procedures

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All admin endpoints require proper authentication
- [ ] Webhook signature validation implemented
- [ ] Debug utilities secured or removed
- [ ] Security audit logging enabled
- [ ] No sensitive data exposure in responses
- [ ] Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

## Priority
CRITICAL - Security vulnerabilities affecting production system

## Technical Notes
Security TODOs identified:
- 3+ admin authentication TODOs
- 6+ webhook security TODOs
- 3+ debug utility TODOs

Estimated effort: 8-12 hours for complete security implementation
