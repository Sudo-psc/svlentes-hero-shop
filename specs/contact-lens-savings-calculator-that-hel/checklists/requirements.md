- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

## Validation Notes

### ✅ PASS - All quality criteria met

**Content Quality**: Specification is written entirely from user/business perspective. No mention of Next.js, React, TypeScript, or other technical implementation details. Focuses on WHAT users need and WHY.

**Requirement Completeness**: All 12 functional requirements have specific, testable acceptance criteria. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section.

**Success Criteria**: All metrics are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- Quantitative: Engagement rate (60%), conversion rate (30%), time on page (45-90s), bounce rate (<40%)
- Qualitative: User understanding, support ticket reduction, sales feedback

**Feature Readiness**: Comprehensive coverage of:
- Primary user flow with 8 detailed steps
- 3 alternative flows (low-cost, high-cost, exploration)
- 5 edge cases with expected behaviors
- 4 error scenarios with system responses
- 12 functional requirements with acceptance criteria
- 10 documented assumptions
- Clear scope boundaries (what's included/excluded)

**No Blocking Issues Found** - Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)

## Status: ✅ APPROVED

Specification meets all quality standards. Ready to proceed to implementation planning.
